# RSOD-Dataset

It is a dataset for object detection in remote sensing images. The dataset includes aircraft, oiltank, playground and overpass.

The format of this dataset that for is PASCAL VOC.

The datase includes 4 files, and each file is for one kind of object.
1. [aircraft dataset](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1eRWFV5C), 4993 aircrafts in 446 images.
2. [playground](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1nuD4KLb), 191 playgrounds in 189 images.
3. [overpass](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1kVKAFB5), 180 overpass in 176 overpass.
4. [oiltank](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1kUZn4zX), 1586 oiltanks in 165 images.
